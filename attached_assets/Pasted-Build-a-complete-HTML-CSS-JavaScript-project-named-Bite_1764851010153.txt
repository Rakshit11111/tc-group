Build a complete HTML + CSS + JavaScript project named “Bite-Sized Learning App (MVP)” based on the following specifications:

📌 PROJECT GOAL  
Create a simple working MVP of a bite-sized learning app inspired by the given problem statement:  
Users should scroll short educational videos, save them to playlists, track progress, and creators should be able to upload content.

📌 FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT (MVP-Level)

1. HOME FEED (Learner Side)
- Infinite-scroll style feed UI
- Each card shows:
  • Short video (use placeholder video links)
  • Title, creator name
  • Topic tags (HTML/CSS/DSA/Aptitude etc.)
  • Like button, Save button
- Feed should be filterable by topic

2. PLAYLISTS
- Learner can add videos to “My Playlist”
- Display saved videos in a separate page (playlist.html)
- LocalStorage-based saving (no backend needed)

3. CREATOR UPLOAD PAGE
- A simple form:
  • Upload video URL
  • Title
  • Topic tags (comma separated)
- When a creator submits:
  • Save the video details to localStorage as new content
  • Content should appear in the learner feed

4. VIDEO VIEW PAGE
- When clicking a feed item → open video.html
- Show:
  • Video
  • AI-Generated Summary (placeholder text)
  • Auto-generated quiz (3 MCQs using JS)

5. BASIC AI MOCK FUNCTIONS
(No backend or real AI required — just JS simulation)
